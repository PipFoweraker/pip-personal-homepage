# WCAG 2.1 Accessibility Compliance

## Problem
The website currently fails basic accessibility standards:
- No ARIA labels or semantic HTML
- Missing alt text for images
- No keyboard navigation support
- No skip links for screen readers
- Poor focus management
- Potentially insufficient color contrast

## Solution
Implement WCAG 2.1 AA compliance across all pages:

### Required Changes
1. **Semantic HTML**: Use proper heading hierarchy, landmarks
2. **ARIA Labels**: Add aria-label, aria-describedby where needed
3. **Alt Text**: All images need descriptive alt attributes
4. **Keyboard Navigation**: Tab order, focus indicators, skip links
5. **Color Contrast**: Audit and fix contrast ratios
6. **Screen Reader Support**: Test with screen reader tools

### Implementation Areas
- Navigation: aria-navigation, current page indicators
- Forms: labels, error messages, validation feedback
- Images: meaningful alt text or aria-hidden for decorative
- Interactive elements: proper focus states
- Content structure: heading hierarchy, landmarks

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] All pages pass WAVE accessibility checker
- [ ] Keyboard navigation works throughout site
- [ ] Color contrast meets WCAG AA standards (4.5:1)
- [ ] Screen reader testing completed
- [ ] Skip links implemented
- [ ] Focus indicators visible and consistent
