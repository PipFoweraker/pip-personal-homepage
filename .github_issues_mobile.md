# Mobile-First Navigation Improvements

## Problem
Current navigation has mobile usability issues:
- No hamburger menu for small screens
- Touch targets may be too small
- Navigation may overflow on mobile
- No mobile-specific interactions
- Responsive design gaps

## Solution
Implement mobile-first navigation with modern UX patterns:

### Required Changes
1. **Hamburger Menu**: Collapsible navigation for mobile
2. **Touch Targets**: Minimum 44px tap targets
3. **Mobile Breakpoints**: Proper responsive behavior
4. **Swipe Gestures**: Optional swipe navigation
5. **Performance**: Smooth animations, no jank

### Implementation Details
- CSS Grid/Flexbox responsive navigation
- JavaScript toggle for mobile menu
- Proper focus management for keyboard users
- ARIA attributes for screen readers
- Smooth animations with `transform` not `left/top`

### Testing Requirements
- Test on actual mobile devices
- Various screen sizes (320px to 768px)
- Portrait and landscape orientations
- Touch and keyboard interaction
- Screen reader compatibility

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Hamburger menu works on screens < 768px
- [ ] All touch targets minimum 44px
- [ ] Navigation accessible via keyboard
- [ ] Smooth animations, no performance issues
- [ ] Tested on iOS and Android devices
- [ ] Screen reader announces menu state
- [ ] No horizontal scrolling on any device
