I'm the CEO of [Beacon](https://beaconfs.org), a 501(c)(3) fiscal sponsorship agency focusing on catastrophic and existential risk, and Executive Director of Research at the [Certes Institute](https://certesinstitute.org), an Australian research organisation working on catastrophic and existential risk.

I build institutions, write occasionally, and work to help humanity navigate the transition to transformative AI.
