## Who I Am

I'm Pip Foweraker. I work at the intersection of technology, institutions, and existential risk.

I serve as CEO of [Beacon](https://beaconfs.org), a 501(c)(3) fiscal sponsorship agency that supports projects addressing catastrophic and existential risks. I'm also Executive Director of Research at the [Certes Institute](https://certesinstitute.org), an Australian research organisation focused on catastrophic and existential risk.

## What I Do

My work focuses on:

- **Institution building** - Creating the organisational infrastructure that enables important work to happen
- **Existential risk research** - Contributing to research and coordination efforts around catastrophic and existential risks, including AI safety
- **Writing** - Thinking in public about technology, strategy, and the future

## Beacon

[Beacon](https://beaconfs.org) is a 501(c)(3) fiscal sponsor that provides infrastructure for projects working on catastrophic and existential risks. We handle the operational complexity—legal structure, compliance, financial administration—so founders and researchers can focus on their mission.

## Certes Institute

The [Certes Institute](https://certesinstitute.org) is an Australian research organisation working on catastrophic and existential risk. As Executive Director of Research, I help shape our research agenda and build the team working on these critical challenges.

## This Site

This site serves as my public home on the internet. It's inspired by [Gwern's approach](https://gwern.net/about) to personal websites: a long-term project that grows organically, with attention to typography, accessibility, and thoughtful presentation.

### Design Philosophy

- **Readability first** - Good typography, comfortable line lengths, sidenotes where useful
- **Progressive enhancement** - Works without JavaScript, better with it
- **Long-term thinking** - Built to last and evolve over years, not months
