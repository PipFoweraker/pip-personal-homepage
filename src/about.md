## Who I Am

I'm Pip Foweraker. I work at the intersection of technology, institutions, and existential risk.

Currently I serve as CEO of [Altruistic Agency](https://altruistic.agency), a fiscal sponsorship organisation that provides infrastructure for high-impact projects. I'm also the incoming Executive Director of an AI safety research organisation.

## What I Do

My work focuses on:

- **Institution building** - Creating the organisational infrastructure that enables important work
- **AI safety** - Contributing to research and coordination efforts around transformative AI
- **Writing** - Thinking in public about technology, strategy, and the future

## This Site

This site serves as my public home on the internet. It's inspired by [Gwern's approach](https://gwern.net/about) to personal websites: a long-term project that grows organically, with attention to typography, accessibility, and thoughtful presentation.

The aesthetic aims for something between clean modernism and baroque ornamentation - we'll see how it evolves.

### Design Philosophy

- **Readability first** - Good typography, comfortable line lengths, sidenotes where useful
- **Progressive enhancement** - Works without JavaScript, better with it
- **Long-term thinking** - Built to last and evolve over years, not months
