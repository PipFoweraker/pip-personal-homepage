Small but necessary crimes are entirely required for the functioning of all non-algorithmically governed civilisations.

TODO: Develop this further
- Examples: the fixer, the guy who knows a guy, informal economies
- Why algorithmic governance breaks this (no discretion, no mercy, no common sense)
- The corruption/efficiency tradeoff curve
- What happens when you eliminate all the necessary crimes (system seizes up)
- Distinction between load-bearing corruption and parasitic corruption
