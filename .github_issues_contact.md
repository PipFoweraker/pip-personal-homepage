# Secure Contact Form Implementation

## Problem
Currently no secure way for visitors to contact you:
- No contact form exists
- Email addresses exposed in HTML (spam risk)
- No CSRF protection or validation
- Missing contact mechanism reduces engagement

## Solution
Implement secure contact form with proper validation and security:

### Features Required
1. **Contact Form**: Name, email, subject, message fields
2. **Client-side Validation**: Real-time feedback, required fields
3. **Server-side Processing**: PHP script or static form service
4. **CSRF Protection**: Token-based form security
5. **Spam Prevention**: Honeypot field, rate limiting
6. **Email Security**: Obfuscated display, secure sending

### Implementation Options
- **Option A**: Static form service (Netlify Forms, Formspree)
- **Option B**: PHP contact script with validation
- **Option C**: JavaScript + email obfuscation

### Security Considerations
- Sanitize all inputs
- Validate email format
- Rate limit submissions
- Log suspicious activity
- Email obfuscation for display

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Contact form accessible via navigation
- [ ] All fields properly validated (client + server)
- [ ] CSRF protection implemented
- [ ] Spam prevention measures active
- [ ] Form submissions tested end-to-end
